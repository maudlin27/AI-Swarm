SHA 320602eafa628d9d4995ffc232096d64eaa99a70 - by Relent0r, June 24, 2023 - ...warm to work properly, add fallback upgradeid check since the UpgradesTo property will return an empty string instead of nil which will caused t3 structures that cant upgrade to run the upgrade thread. Add support factory check for upgrade thread so that support factories will not try and upgrade when no HQ is available. Fix a couple of global vars that should be local (there are MANY more that have this problem across the AI which will cause strange behaviors in team games with multiple swarm ai).
